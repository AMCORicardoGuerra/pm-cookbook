Paleo Maple Salmon Fillets

## Ingredients
* 8 6-oz. salmon fillets or salmon steaks
* 1 lemon, cut into wedges
* 4 teaspoon extra virgin olive oil
* ⅛ teaspoon nutmeg
* ⅛ teaspoon cinnamon
* 2 Tablespoon garlic powder
* ¾ teaspoon fine ground sea salt
* 1 Tablespoon onion powder
* ⅛ teaspoon black pepper
* ¼ cup gluten-free soy sauce or Tamari
* ¼ to ½ cup grade-B maple syrup
* Optional: Black pepper corns (garnish)

## Instructions
* Rinse and dry salmon fillets.
* Rub each with lemon wedge.
* Brush 2 teaspoons oil on flesh side of salmon (to help seasoning adhere).
* In bowl, mix nutmeg, cinnamon, garlic powder, salt, onion powder and black pepper.
* Sprinkle each filet with homemade spice mix.
* Let sit covered in fridge for 1 hour.
* Sauce/Marinade: In saucepan, mix together soy sauce and maple syrup over medium heat until sauce is thick enough to coast the back of a spoon (about 7 to 10 minutes).
* At same time, heat skillet and coat bottom with 2 teaspoon oil.
* When oil is hot, place salmon in skillet, flesh side down, and cook over high heat for about 4 minutes or until brown.
* Flip over.
* Pour the sauce/marinade over the newly exposed sides of the fillets and cook another 4 minutes with the sauce on top. This will then cook like a glaze, slightly caramelizing the soy sauce and maple syrup.
* Remove and garnish with peppercorns and pour remaining “cooked” sauce over the fish, if you’d like.

OPTION: you can reserve the sauce/marinade and pour over on top of the fillets after you finished cooking the fillets, if you’d like. This is a fun option to the dish and will actually taste slightly different.
